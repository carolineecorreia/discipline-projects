# RodaDaFortuna/Wheel of Fortune
Final Project of the Object Oriented Programming discipline, made in pairs. 
We developed a version of the Wheel of Fortune, a popular game in the USA. For Brazilians, it's the Roda a Roda Jequiti, by Silvio Santos.
This was all done in Java and the GUI made with JavaFX and SceneBuilder.
