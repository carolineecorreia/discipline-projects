Relevant projects of which I was part or did it all by myself. In my graduation course, we learned how to code and use the applications for real-life problems.
The languages we used were C, C++, Java, MATLAB, and Python, which include fundamentals of computer programs, data structures, data analysis, optimization and object-oriented 
programming.

I've just had the ideia of bulding this repository and unfortunately I don't have many works I've already done since 2016 anymore.. But, I' will put 
everthing I think it's relevant from now on :)
