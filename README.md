Some final big projects of which I made part of or did by myself. In my graduation course, we learn how to code and use the applications for real life problems.
The languages we see are C, C++, Java, MATLAB and Python, which includes fundamentals of computer programs, data structures, data analysis, optimization and object-oriented 
programming.

I've just had the ideia of bulding this repository and it's a pity that I don't have many works I've already done since 2016 anymore.. But, I' will put 
everthing I think it's relevant from now on :)
